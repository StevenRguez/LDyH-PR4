In
presenting
this
reconstruction<SPLIT>
,
based
in
a
large
measure
upon
interpretations
which
took
their
origins
from
the
work
conducted
at
Ocmulgee<SPLIT>
,
the
National
Park
Service
would
like
to
acknowledge
the
debt
of
archeology
to
three
gentlemen
of
Macon<SPLIT>
,
Ga.
Charles
C
.
Harrold<SPLIT>
,
Walter
A
.
Harris<SPLIT>
,
and
Linton
M
.
Solomon
were
aware
of
the
importance
of
the
large
mound
and
village
site
close
to
their
community
and
deeply
interested
in
its
thorough
study
and
ultimate
preservation<SPLIT>
.
It
was
through
their
devoted
efforts
that
the
large-scale
excavations
were
undertaken
,
and
the
site
of
this
important
work
preserved
as
Ocmulgee
National
Monument<SPLIT>
.
From
the
middle
of
the
18th
century
until
1934
the
Indian
mounds
near
the
present
city
of
Macon<SPLIT>
,
Ga.<SPLIT>
,
had
been
a
subject
for
speculation
to
all
who
saw
them<SPLIT>
.
A
ranger
journeying
with
Oglethorpe<SPLIT>
,
founder
of
the
Georgia
Colony<SPLIT>
,
mentions
"<SPLIT>three
Mounts
raised
by
the
Indians
over
three
of
their
Great
Kings
who
were
killed
in
the
Wars<SPLIT>
.<SPLIT>
"
A
more
discerning
traveler
in
the
same
century
could
learn
that
contemporary
Indians
and
generations
of
their
ancestors
knew
nothing
of
the
origin
of
these
mounds<SPLIT>
,
where
ghostly
singing
was
said
to
mark
the
early
morning
hours<SPLIT>
.
As
late
as
1930<SPLIT>
,
however<SPLIT>
,
even
specialists
could
only
add
that
the
large
pyramidal
mound
showed
connections
with
the
cultures
of
the
Mississippi
Valley
and
that
a
second
mound
had
served
as
a
burial
mound<SPLIT>
.
In
1933<SPLIT>
,
it
was
possible<SPLIT>
,
with
labor
furnished
by
the
Civil
Works
Administration<SPLIT>
,
to
begin
a
systematic
exploration
of
the
Ocmulgee
mounds
and
adjoining
sites<SPLIT>
.
This
work
continued
until
1941<SPLIT>
,
most
of
it
being
performed
by
the
Works
Progress
Administration
and
the
Civilian
Conservation
Corps<SPLIT>
.
In
1933<SPLIT>
,
also<SPLIT>
,the
citizens
of
Macon
purchased
the
land
and
gave
it
to
the
Nation<SPLIT>
.
Ocmulgee
National
Monument
was
authorized
by
Congress
in
June
1934
and
established
by
Presidential
proclamation
in
December
1936<SPLIT>
.
Eight
years'
work<SPLIT>
,
involving
the
removal
of
untold
tons
of
earth
and
the
recovery
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
artifacts<SPLIT>
,
has
established
the
archeological
significance
of
Ocmulgee<SPLIT>
.
It
has
demonstrated
the
existence
here
in
one
small
area
of
material
remains
from
almost
every
major
period
of
Indian
prehistory
in
the
Southeast<SPLIT>
.
Being
one
of
the
first
large
Indian
sites
in
the
South
to
be
scientifically
excavated<SPLIT>
,
Ocmulgee
provided
many
of
the
important
details
in
our
expanding
knowledge
of
that
story<SPLIT>
.
